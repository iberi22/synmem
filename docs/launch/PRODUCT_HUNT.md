## Full Description (for "About" section)

### What is SynMem?

SynMem (Synthetic Memory) is a revolutionary browser agent that bridges the gap between AI assistants and the authenticated web. Unlike traditional scraping tools, SynMem lets AI agents use YOUR browser sessions - meaning they can access your logged-in accounts, remember context, and automate complex workflows.

### Key Features

🦀 **Built in Rust** - Blazing fast with Rayon parallelization
🔐 **Session Persistence** - Use your authenticated cookies securely
🧠 **Semantic Memory** - Vector-based search across browsing history
🔌 **MCP Protocol** - Native integration with Claude, GPT & more
🌐 **Universal Scraping** - Works with any website
🎯 **Site-Specific Extractors** - Optimized for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Twitter

### Use Cases

- **AI Research** - Let AI assistants gather information from authenticated sources
- **Workflow Automation** - Automate repetitive browser tasks
- **Chat Export** - Extract and search conversations from AI platforms
- **Social Media Management** - Read and compose across platforms

### Why SynMem?

Traditional AI agents are blind to the authenticated web. They can't access your emails, social feeds, or AI conversations. SynMem changes that - securely exposing your browser sessions to AI via the MCP protocol.

### Open Source

SynMem is 100% open source (Apache 2.0). The core engine is free forever. Premium cloud features available for teams.

## First Comment (by Maker)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [NAME], creator of SynMem. After months of frustration with AI assistants that couldn't access my authenticated sessions, I decided to build the tool I wished existed.

**The Problem**: AI agents are blind to the logged-in web. They can't read your emails, check your feeds, or access your AI conversations without complex, fragile workarounds.

**The Solution**: SynMem exposes your browser sessions to AI via MCP protocol. It's like giving your AI assistant the ability to browse as you - securely.

**Why Rust?** Performance. SynMem can scrape and process 10 pages in parallel in under 2 seconds thanks to Rayon parallelization.

**What's unique:**
- 🔐 Secure session management (encrypted cookies, Argon2 key derivation)
- 🧠 Semantic memory (search your browsing history by meaning)
- 🎯 Site-specific extractors (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Twitter)
- 🔌 MCP protocol native (works with Claude Desktop out of the box)

**This is just the beginning.** On the roadmap:
- Chrome extension for real-time sync
- Cloud sessions for team collaboration
- Scraper marketplace

Would love to hear your feedback and use cases! 🙏
